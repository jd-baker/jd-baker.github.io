<p><b><i>This image was created accidently when I was using different tools in Photoshop. The original image was simply an eye with a zombie reflecting in it. When I finished with it I decided to duplicate it and flip the image to see what it would look like, I then repeated this again and the image looked very interesting. The colour was completely different to what it is now. The previous colour was red and white. To get it to the new colour I inverted it. This gave it a darker colour with a light blue. I then changed the contrast and colour a bit to create the final image which I feel is one of my best pieces of work.</I></b><p>
